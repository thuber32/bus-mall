<h1> Task: Create User Stories</h1>
<hr/>
<p>Part of your assignment today is to write your own user stories. Be sure to consider the multiple roles involved: the marketing research team, the developer, and the focus group participant who will be using the application. Try to write 4-5 user stories for each role. DO THIS STEP FIRST in a file called user_stories.md. The commit logs in your repo will have a first couple of commits for the scaffolding process, but next you should have a 'user stories' commit that is in place before any code is written.</p>
